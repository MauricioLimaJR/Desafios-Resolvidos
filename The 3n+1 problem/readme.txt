All the folders (The 3n + 1 problem) contains a project from Code Blocks IDE.

To execute the code:

   -Do the download of this folder and open with your Code Blocks IDE;
   -Or copy the code on 'The 3n + 1 problem/man.c' arquive and run on
     another IDE program (compiler for ANSI C);

The first folder contains the code to UVA Oline Jugde.
My runtime execution is 0.020.

So, the program already is working, but I'll change the code for get a less
run time.
